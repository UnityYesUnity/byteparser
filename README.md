# How to use ByteParser v3

## 1) Setting up python
Go to the Python Windows download site and download the latest version. 
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

After Python has downloaded, open the installer (the file you have just downloaded) and make sure the following box is checked before pressing install:

After installation, your Python is all set up.

## 2) Downloading and installing ByteParser
Download the **ByteParser_v3.zip** file, right click it in file explorer and press Extract all, and extract all the files to downloads (should be the default).

Open/run the Installer.bat file and follow the instructions (e.g Press any key to continue…) and wait until all of the modules have installed *(if anything goes wrong please dm me)*

After that, ByteParser should open, and from then on you can open it using the QuickRun.bat file.

*Make sure the web version of roblox is installed. If you are using UWP, please delete it and install web roblox.*

## 3) Exploiting
Make sure Roblox and a previously running ByteParser processes

Open/run the QuickRun.bat file and wait until the console (ByteParser) displays ‘Please open Roblox for web’, then join this game:
https://www.roblox.com/games/15392503372/OMGExploits

Once you have joined the game, the console window (ByteParser) should prompt you to press enter after teleportation, when this appears, put a game id or select a built in game on the ‘Byfron Teleporter’ ui, then press join game.

After teleportation, get a tool (some games have tools in inventory by default but otherwise find one), then press enter on the console/ByteParser process and injection will begin.

Once injected, it will display on the console what tool has been injected into. When it tells you to equip the tool multiple times, do so and the exploit should appear on the screen.

**FAQ:
What scripts can it run?:
```_G.IY() –- Infinite yield```The built-in scripts visible in the side frame are checked and confirmed working scripts. Otherwise many basic non-loadstring scripts may run.

Why is it crashing/freezing/failing to inject/winapi failing? How can I stop this?
Try again. It's the only fix until I release UWP.

How do I know its not a virus?
ByteParser is completely open source:
